### License Plate Recognition System

#### Description:
The License Plate Recognition (LPR) System is a computer vision project designed to detect and recognize license plates in images or video streams. It utilizes machine learning and image processing techniques to locate license plates within images or frames and then extract alphanumeric characters from the plates.

#### Features:
- Detects license plates from images or video streams.
- Extracts alphanumeric characters from the detected license plates.
- Supports real-time processing for video streams.
- Provides accuracy in recognizing license plate characters.
- Highly configurable for various environments and scenarios.

#### Technologies Used:
- Python
- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)
- Machine Learning/Deep Learning Models (such as Convolutional Neural Networks)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)
- Flask (for web-based interface, optional)

#### Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/license_plate_recognition.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download pre-trained models (if necessary) and place them in the appropriate directory.

#### Usage:
1. Run the main script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
2. Follow the instructions for providing input images or video streams.
3. View the output with detected license plates and recognized characters.

#### Configuration:
- Adjust parameters such as confidence thresholds, model paths, and input/output settings in the configuration file (`config.py`).

#### Contributions:
Contributions to the project are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request.

#### License:
